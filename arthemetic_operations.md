#   Arithmetic Operators

|Operator    | Example  | Meaning| Result|
| ----------|--------------|--------------|------|
|+ (unary)	|+a	    |    **Unary Positive**	                | a In other words, it doesnâ€™t really do anything. It mostly exists for the sake of completeness, to complement Unary Negation.|
|+ (binary) |a + b   |   **Addition**	                        | Sum of a and b|
|- (unary)	|-a	     |   **Unary Negation**	                    | Value equal to a but opposite in sign|
|- (binary) |a - b|  |   **Subtraction**	                    | b subtracted from a|
|*	        |a * b	 |   **Multiplication**	                    | Product of a and b|
|/	        |a / b	 |   **Division**	                        | Quotient when a is divided by b. The result always has type float.|
|%	        |a % b	 |   **Modulo**	                            | Remainder when a is divided by b|
|//	        | a // b |	 **Floor Division (also called Integer Division)**	|Quotient when a is divided by b, rounded to the next smallest whole number|
|**	        | a ** b |	 **Exponentiation**	                    | a raised to the power of b|
