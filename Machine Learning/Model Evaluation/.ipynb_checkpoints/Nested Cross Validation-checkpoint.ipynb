    "Often we want to tune the parameters of a model (for example, C in a support vector machine). That is, we want to find the value of a parameter that minimizes our loss function. The best way to do this is cross validation:\n",

    "Split your data into K ‘folds’ (sections).\n",

    "However, as Cawley and Talbot point out in their 2010 paper, since we used the test set to both select the values of the parameter and evaluate the model, we risk optimistically biasing our model evaluations. For this reason, if a test set is used to select model parameters, then we need a different test set to get an unbiased evaluation of that selected model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to overcome this problem is to have nested cross validations. First, an inner cross validation is used to tune the parameters and select the best model. Second, an outer cross validation is used to evaluate the model selected by the inner cross validation."
