#playsound is a “pure Python, cross platform, single function module with no dependencies for playing sounds.” With this module, you can play a sound file with a single line of code:

from playsound import playsound
playsound('/path/to/a/sound/file/you/want/to/play.mp3')

#This library was last updated in June 2017. It seems to work well at the time of writing this article, but it’s not clear whether it will still support newer Python releases.
